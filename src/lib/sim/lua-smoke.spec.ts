// Three tests, and the count never moves - each loops over the Lua entries
// internally and names the entry in its message, so waves 5 and 6 add
// configurations without touching a number here. The budget, canonical form and
// subset questions belong to src/lib/catalog/lua-entries.sweep.spec.ts; this file asks
// the only question a static analysis cannot: does it work.
//
// Every entry is put through the SAME scripted gesture, so the gate is uniform:
// a drag (a press followed by six moves along a diagonal, two ticks apart), a
// lift, and a fast tap - firmware event 9, which several configurations treat as
// their only programming gesture, and which is coalesced from a sub-cycle
// press-and-lift so it arrives with no separate press or lift of its own.
//
// The engine is assembled here from renderLua plus createLuaHost rather than
// through createEngine, for one reason: the pitfall-1 guard has to read the raw
// layer records, and a SimEngine deliberately exposes only the rendered frame.
// The Lua text and the wrapped simulator are identical either way - this is the
// same construction createLuaPadSim performs.
