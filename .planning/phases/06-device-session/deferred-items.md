# Phase 6 — deferred items

Out-of-scope discoveries logged during execution. Nothing here is fixed by the
plan that found it.

## 1. `docs/TESTING.md` carries a stale `test:quick` literal (found by 06-01)

`docs/TESTING.md` line 22 reads `66 files, 691 passed + 1 todo (692); 25 s wall
(22.7 s)`. Plan 06-01 took the tree to **66 files / 694 tests + 1 todo (695)**,
so the line is stale from this commit onwards, and every later plan in the phase
moves it again.

**Not fixed here, deliberately.** `06-14-PLAN.md` names `docs/TESTING.md` in its
`files_modified` and its task 2 re-measures the whole document end to end
against a fresh production build. Editing it fourteen times on the way would be
churn against a number that is wrong again by the next commit, and no spec reads
the file, so nothing is green-and-vacuous in the meantime.

**Owner:** plan 06-14, task 2.
