# Phase 10 — deferred items

Out-of-scope discoveries, logged rather than fixed. Nothing here is red.

## From 10-02

**`/dev/type/`'s Quicksand column now renders Inter.** `src/routes/dev/type/+page.svelte:150`
declares `.quicksand { font-family: var(--font-sans); }`, and `--font-sans` became Inter Variable
in 10-02-01, so the probe's two columns are now the same face and its comparison is degenerate.
Nothing is red: no spec and no e2e test reads the probe (`grep -rn "measure-column\|dev/type"` over
`e2e/` and `src/` outside the file itself returns nothing), the route is unlinked, and the
measurement it produced is recorded in `10-01-SUMMARY.md` and is not re-taken. The probe was an
instrument for one measurement that is finished. Not fixed here because the file is outside
10-02's `files_modified` and the plan's delta is `+0 files`. Whoever next touches `/dev/`
should either retire the route or point `.quicksand` at a real second face.

**`gen-licenses.mjs` deprecation warning.** `npm run licenses` prints
`[DEP0190] DeprecationWarning: Passing args to a child process with shell option true`. It comes
from `checker()`'s `execFileSync(..., { shell: process.platform === "win32" })` at
`scripts/gen-licenses.mjs:52-59`, which predates this phase. Exit code is 0 and the output is
correct. Pre-existing, not caused by 10-02, not fixed here.
